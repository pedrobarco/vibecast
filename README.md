## Overview

**Vibecast** is a terminal user interface (TUI) for managing, searching, and playing IPTV playlists.  
It is player-agnostic and library-agnostic: you can use it with any player that supports opening URLs from the command line (e.g., VLC, mpv, etc.).

**Features:**
- Add, remove, and edit IPTV playlists (local files or URLs)
- Search and filter channels with fuzzy matching
- Bookmark (favorite) channels per playlist
- Play channels in your preferred player (VLC, mpv, etc.)
- Keyboard-driven, Vim-like navigation
- Portable YAML configuration

## Configuration

- The config file is stored at:  
  `$HOME/.config/vibecast/config.yaml`

- Example config:

```yaml
playlists:
  - name: My IPTV
    path: /path/to/playlist.m3u
  - name: Remote List
    path: https://example.com/iptv.m3u
favourites:
  "My IPTV":
    - Channel 1
    - Channel 2
  "Remote List":
    - News Channel
```

- You can copy this file to another machine and Vibecast will work out-of-the-box.

## Supported Players

Vibecast is player-agnostic. By default, it will try to open channels using the system's default handler for URLs:

- **macOS:** `open -a VLC <url>` (or your default player)
- **Linux:** `xdg-open <url>`
- **Windows:** `start <url>`

You can configure your system to use your preferred player for streaming URLs.

---

## Supported Playlist Formats

- **M3U** (local files or remote URLs)

(Other formats may be supported in the future.)

---

## FAQ / Troubleshooting

**Q: I only hear audio, but don't see video in VLC.**  
A: Make sure VLC is set as your system's default handler for streaming URLs, and that you are not running VLC in RC-only mode.

**Q: How do I use a different player?**  
A: Change your system's default handler for streaming URLs (e.g., set mpv as default for `http://` links).

**Q: Where is my config stored?**  
A: `$HOME/.config/vibecast/config.yaml`
